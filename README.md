# OptimizedNetworkFlow by IBM Rapids

Optimizing the flow of Indus River Basin in Pakistan by using currently available data of dams,rivers and reserviors. An attempt to reduce damages caused by major floodings. Looking forward to being able to make more geographically optimized water reservoirs that not only save floods but also can allow major preservation of water for a country in crisis of the resource.

Although the base case is Pakistan's river basin, the technology used allows it to be portable to any scenarios in the future.

# Dashboard and Application

The application is hosted on BlueMix Cloud and can be visited here

https://dashboardapp.au-syd.mybluemix.net/

The dashboard is tested and works perfectly on Internet Explorer.

# Limitations

Currently, the dashboard is a stored active report of the initial data as Cognos Analytics Dashboards do not allow sharing of free dashboards and the prepared dashboard was not visible to other users except the one who developed it (even after permission level changes). Since we could only make active reports, the data used in the dashboard does not respond to changes in the program. 

However the main databsae and the program do interact each other through a proper connection.
