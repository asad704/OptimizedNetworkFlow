# OptimizedNetworkFlow

Optimizing the flow of Indus River Basin in Pakistan by using currently available data of dams,rivers and reserviors. An attempt to reduce damages caused by major floodings. Looking forward to being able to make more geographically optimized water reservoirs that not only save floods but also can allow major preservation of water for a country in crisis of the resource.
